Fall 3\\
Last week I had clarified the exact details of the project with my group mates and also contributed to the problem statement by revising the abstract, writing the problem definition, and writing both the introduction and some of the conclusion.\\ Planning with teammates about the requirements document and discussing problem statement with client.\\ Had some clarification issues with some details in the problem statement. Client was also on vacation so could not verify whether the document fit his criteria early enough.\\

Last week our group had met with our client and had him look over our problem statement and provide feedback. I also corrected some grammatical and formatting errors with my section of the document. I also corrected the document based on the client's feedback.\\ Next week we need to get our client to sign our final draft of the problem statement. We also are going to have a rough draft of a requirements document by Wednesday to have ample time to set up a meeting to discuss with the client.\\ We had a problem when scheduling our meeting with the client as not all the group members were able to attend. I also had trouble figuring out why apostrophes would not show up properly on our tex document.\\

Final Post\\
If you were to redo the project from Fall term, what would you tell yourself?\\
I believe one of the biggest issues my team faced was that we got caught up in some of the more non-essential parts of the project and we didn't focus on completing the project before working on stretch goals and interesting mechanics.\\
\\
What's the biggest skill you've learned?\\
The biggest skill I have learned during this process is how to be able to talk about a project on multiple different levels of complexity.\\
\\
What skills do you see yourself using in the future?\\
The skills I have learned on how to explain my project and how to properly work in a team and manage my time appropriately.\\
\\
What did you like about the project, and what did you not?\\
I liked the concept and the coding of the project. It just felt like the schedule was catered more towards larger and more complex projects and I would have like to have more time focusing on development rather than extraneous planning.\\
\\
What did you learn from your teammates?\\
My teammates taught me a lot of technical skills that they were used to using and I believe I also helped them with it as well.\\
\\
If you were the client for this project, would you be satisfied with the work done?\\
I believe we provided a good starting point for students to use to supplement their research and learning.\\
\\
If your project were to be continued next year, what do you think needs to be working on?\\
The actual artificial intelligence portion of the code would be the focus as our project's main purpose was to supplement the development of that process.\\
\\
Speak a little about your expo experience.\\
I spoke with many individuals ranging from industry reps to people who did not really know what a video game was.\\
