	This project is to create an agent to play the game Starcraft Brood War, a real time strategy game created by Blizzard Entertainment. After this project is complete, it could be expanded upon by future students in a club setting. This project will be a template so that future students can strive to develop better solutions than those developed within this project. This document will provide the details of the project as well as provide a list of tasks the development team must complete. The goal of this document is to specify the requirements for the system to be developed.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Technologies}

\subsection{Programming paradigm for functions}
\subsubsection{Options}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ ||C|L|L|| } 
\hline
Paradigm & Description & Reason for Selection \\
 \hline
 Modular & Paradigm focused on separating functions into independent modules. & Modular has a high focus on independence of functions. \\ 
 \hline
 Object Oriented & Paradigm focused on objects such as data and attributes rather than actions. & Objects can help to section off parts of the program. \\ 
 \hline
 Recursion & Paradigm focused on solving a larger problem using solution from multiple smaller problems. & The program requires the solution of many smaller sections. \\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Programming language}
\subsubsection{Options}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ ||C|L|L|| } 
\hline
Language & Description & Reason for Selection \\
 \hline
 C++ & Commonly used programming language with many functionalities derived from C. & It is commonly taught and used and is the recommended language from BWAPI. \\ 
 \hline
 Java & Class-based programming language that promotes few implementation dependencies. & It can be run on many different systems.\\ 
 \hline
 C Sharp & Programming language derived from C mainly used for object oriented code. & It has a high focus on objects while keeping a lot of the functions of C. \\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Environment and IDEs}
\subsubsection{Options}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ ||C|L|L|| } 
\hline
IDE & Description & Reason for Selection \\
 \hline
 Visual Studio[1] & IDE created by Microsoft that can create Windows programs.  & Highly popular IDE for C++ and C Sharp and recommended by BWAPI. \\ 
 \hline
 Eclipse[2] & Cross-platform IDE mainly used for Java. Eclipse requires plugins in order to customize the environment. & Popular IDE for both Java and C++ projects. \\ 
 \hline
 IntelliJ IDEA[3] & Java integrated IDE that supports cross-platform and was created by JetBrains.
 & Thorough tools and development centered around Java. \\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{APIs}
\subsubsection{Options}
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ ||C|L|L|| } 
		\hline
		API & Description & Reason for Selection \\
		\hline
		BWAPI & BWAPI designed to build AI agents. & Includes functionality to automate necessary game mechanics and use information on the current state of the game. \\ 
		\hline
		Brood Data API & API focused on data mining for future use in machine-learning algorithms for AI or competitive player training. & Useful for gathering data for design algorithms.\\ 
		\hline
		 BW Spectator Interface API & API designed for spectator-mode interface customization with real-time game stats and interaction with units. & Useful for observing performance of AI. \\ 
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Documentation for API}
\subsubsection{Options}
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ ||C|L|L|| } 
		\hline
		Source & Description & Reason for Selection \\
		\hline
		BWAPI  & Commonly used programming language with many functionalities derived from C. & It is commonly taught and used and is the recommended language from BWAPI. \\ 
		\hline
		BWAPI Wiki & Web page with links to BWAPI source code documentations as well as other links to other BWAPI related information such as extensions, tutorials and game fundamentals. & Useful for identifying and explaining all of the tools available to the project. \\ 
		\hline
		Source Code Comments & Explanations of code functionality directly within the code. & Concise explanation of code located inside of the code for easy access. \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Choice algorithm}
\subsubsection{Options}
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ ||C|L|L|| } 
		\hline
		Type & Description & Reason for Selection \\
		\hline
	Scripted Tree Selection & Creating a tree with scripted strategies to alternate between in response to game data. & Significantly easier implementation that still provides flexibility between strategies. \\ 
		\hline
		Machine Learning - Supervised & AI would base decisions on outcomes of previous instances of decisions and those outcomes. & Identifies patterns in outcomes and can eventually identify the appropriate response based on previous successes or mistakes. \\ 
		\hline
		Machine Learning - Reinforcement Learning & Creates a reward system for which the program will attempt to maximize reward by responding to each point of data given. & Powerful when making decisions and evaluating the effectiveness of that decision given the current state of the game. \\ 
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
