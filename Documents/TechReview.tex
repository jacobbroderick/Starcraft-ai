	This project is to create an agent to play the game Starcraft Brood War, a real time strategy game created by Blizzard Entertainment. After this project is complete, it could be expanded upon by future students in a club setting. This project will be a template so that future students can strive to develop better solutions than those developed within this project. This document will provide the details of the project as well as provide a list of tasks the development team must complete. The goal of this document is to specify the requirements for the system to be developed.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Technologies}

\subsection{Programming paradigm for functions}
\subsubsection{Options}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ ||C|L|L|| } 
\hline
Paradigm & Description & Reason for Selection \\
 \hline
 Modular & Paradigm focused on separating functions into independent modules. & Modular has a high focus on independence of functions. \\ 
 \hline
 Object Oriented & Paradigm focused on objects such as data and attributes rather than actions. & Objects can help to section off parts of the program. \\ 
 \hline
 Recursion & Paradigm focused on solving a larger problem using solution from multiple smaller problems. & The program requires the solution of many smaller sections. \\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Programming language}
\subsubsection{Options}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ ||C|L|L|| } 
\hline
Language & Description & Reason for Selection \\
 \hline
 C++ & Commonly used programming language with many functionalities derived from C. & It is commonly taught and used and is the recommended language from BWAPI. \\ 
 \hline
 Java & Class-based programming language that promotes few implementation dependencies. & It can be run on many different systems.\\ 
 \hline
 C Sharp & Programming language derived from C mainly used for object oriented code. & It has a high focus on objects while keeping a lot of the functions of C. \\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Environment and IDEs}
\subsubsection{Options}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ ||C|L|L|| } 
\hline
IDE & Description & Reason for Selection \\
 \hline
 Visual Studio[1] & IDE created by Microsoft that can create Windows programs.  & Highly popular IDE for C++ and C Sharp and recommended by BWAPI. \\ 
 \hline
 Eclipse[2] & Cross-platform IDE mainly used for Java. Eclipse requires plugins in order to customize the environment. & Popular IDE for both Java and C++ projects. \\ 
 \hline
 IntelliJ IDEA[3] & Java integrated IDE that supports cross-platform and was created by JetBrains.
 & Thorough tools and development centered around Java. \\
