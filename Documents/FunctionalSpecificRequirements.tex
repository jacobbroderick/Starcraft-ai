--Functional Requirements--

Our agent will use the BWAPI to interact with the Starcraft Brood War game. Our agent will follow a scripted strategy. Since the intent is for the agent to play the game on its own, there is no user interface beyond running the program. People can potentially play against the agent, however this requires no additional interaction with our agent. The scripted strategies will be based on how we can engineer the agent to gather resources and expend them while also eliminating the opponent's ability to do these things.

--Specific Requirements--

The agent should be comprised of modular components that are well-documented. Functionality should be broken into stand-alone pieces that could nearly directly translate into another developer's agent. Also, these pieces should be well enough documented such that a developer can understand and make adjustments to them per their needs. Our stretch goal is to give the agent the ability to switch between scripts based on game circumstances. This would mean adjusting to a new strategy based on the agent's resources and potentially the opponents estimated resources.
