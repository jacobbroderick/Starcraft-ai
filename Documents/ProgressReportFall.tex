	The goal of this project is to create an agent to play the game Starcraft Brood War, a real time strategy game created by Blizzard Entertainment. The solution to the project will be a template that future students can use to develop better solutions than those provided in this project. In this document, we will discuss what we have completed in our project as well as discuss our process and problems we had. The goal of this document is to reflect on our progress as well as make sure we are on time and on task.

\section{Recap of Projects' Purposes and Goals}
\subsection{Problem statement}
In this document, we clarified the exact problem that the client wanted solved. We also discovered how in depth the client wanted our product to cover. Throughout the process we also detailed who we were creating the product for. Using this newly gathered information we were able to come up with specific requirements for our next document as well as give the development team a way to constantly remember what the main purpose of the project is.

\subsection{Requirements document}
The requirements document detailed the specifics of what is needed in our program. It also provided a checklist for the development team to follow to know what to include in the program. After the requirements were specified, we then needed to decide on the supplemental technologies we would use in our development process.

\subsection{Technology review}
The technology review helped to compare the different technologies that could be used in our development process. Knowing the criteria for the ideal technology, we compared multiple different technologies with a variety of purposes. This helped to establish what environment the development team would be working in as well as informing the team what they would need to be familiar with.

\subsection{Design document}
The design document did something I don't know yet.
