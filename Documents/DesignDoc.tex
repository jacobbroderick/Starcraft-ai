	The goal of this project is to create an agent to play the game Starcraft Brood War, a real time strategy game created by Blizzard Entertainment. The solution to the project will be a template that future students can use to develop better solutions than those provided in this project. In this document, we will discuss how we will design and implement our project. The design choices we make will help as a road map and checklist to follow.

\section{Design Stakeholders}
	A major stakeholder in the design process is future students involved in an Oregon State University club. These students will be reading and using the code included in the project.
	
\section{Design concerns}
	The design concerns of the future students are that the code is well documented and organized. 
	
	
\section{Design Views}
	The code is well documented if it has concise comments and includes functional headers. In order for the code to be organized, it must be modularized into simple functions and further separated into header files containing functions with similar purposes. The functions also need to be listed in order of complexity with the most complex functions requiring the highest amount of dependencies is located at the bottom.
